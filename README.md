# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Backend Configuration
# URL of the backend API server
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Mock Data Configuration
# Set to "true" to use mock data (no backend required)
# Set to "false" or remove to use real backend
USE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

### Mock Mode

When `USE_MOCK_DATA=true`, the app runs with sample data and doesn't require a backend server. This is useful for:
- Frontend development without backend dependencies
- UI testing and demos
- Offline development

To switch to real backend, set `USE_MOCK_DATA=false` or edit `mocks/config.ts` directly.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
